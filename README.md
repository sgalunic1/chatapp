Chat App v1.0



As you might have noticed, I don't know how to "version" my projects.
That is also beside the point, this project is just adaptation of Scaledrone React example.
I made their example that was made with OOP logic, into a FP project.

Almost the same, I just did not do the classes. Nor style it.

Reason for this project is simple, I find documentation on Scaledrone lacking, 
hell in some places, there are errors in the code. 

This way I will have original version, in FP logic, ready for final Project
that I will have to do for Algebra in order to earn that certificate.

Onwards to another project!
